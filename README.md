## About Me
- Pronouns: he/him/his
- Iâ€™m currently working on improving processes on design systems.
- Iâ€™m currently learning German, Japanese, piano, photography, and low level programming!
- I love me a good mechanical keyboard, I'm rocking the [ZSA Moonlander Mark I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) and the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/)!
- I've recently picked up 3D printing! You can find me on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@cadomac_1434444)!
- Fun fact: I am a moderate protan, meaning my red-green color vision is deficient.

If you like my work, please consider buying me a coffee over at Ko-fi!
