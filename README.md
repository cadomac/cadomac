## About Me
- Pronouns: he/him/his
- I'm a design technologist / front-end engineer. I do a lot of work in design systems and embedding myself in UX teams.
- I’m currently learning German, Japanese, piano, photography, and low level programming!
- I love me a good mechanical keyboard, I'm rocking the [ZSA Moonlander Mark I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) and the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/)! (I have a Svalboard kit on the way that I'm very excited about)
- I'm a 3D printing geek! You can find me on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@bigheadcam)!
- Fun fact: I am a moderate protan, meaning my red-green color vision is deficient.

If you like my work, please consider buying me a coffee over at Ko-fi!
