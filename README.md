## About Me
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- 🎨 I’m currently working on improving developer processes on design systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning German, piano, photography, and more advanced React topics!
- 💻 I love me a good mechanical keyboard, I'm rocking the [ZSA Moonlander Mark I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) and the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/)!
- 🔩 I've recently picked up 3D printing! You can find me on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@cadomac_1434444)!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a moderate protan, meaning my green color vision is deficient.

If you like my work, [please consider buying me a coffee over at Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/cadoma)!
